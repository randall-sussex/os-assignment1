experiment 1
what effect does the varying burst times have on the scheduler efficiency?
test 1
	> high number of bursts
	> low burst times
test 2
	> high number of bursts
	> high burst time
test 3
	> high burst times
	> low number of bursts
	> same seed as t2
test 4
	> low burst time
	> low number of bursts
	> same seed as t1
test 5
	> average number of bursts
	> average burst times

experiment 2
What effect does the number of bursts have on the scheduler?
	all generators will use the same seed
	15 processes
test 1
	> burst times 20
	> 40 bursts
test 2
	> burst time 20
	> 20 bursts
test 3
	> burst time 20
	> 10 bursts 
test 4
	> burst time 20
	> 100 bursts

experiment 3
How does the priorety change the efficiency of the schedulers?
	tests will be composed of multiple parts
test 1
	part 1
		> prio 0
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 200
	part 2
		> prio 1
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 50
	part 3 
		> prio 2
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 10
test 2
	> prio 0
	> 10 bursts
	> burst time 50

test 3
same seed as t2
	part 1
		> prio 0
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 50
	part 2
		> prio 1
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 50
	part 3 
		> prio 2
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 50
test 4

	part 1
		> prio 0
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 10
	part 2
		> prio 1
		> 3 processes
		> burst time 50
	part 3
		> prio 2
		> 3 proccesses
		> burst time 200
