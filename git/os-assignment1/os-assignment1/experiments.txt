What effect does the work load have on the schedulers?
	// test with work loads of varying sizes
	// multiple processes with high burst time
	// multiple processes with low burst times
	// vary number of bursts
What effect does the variety of burst time have on scheduler efficiency??
	// same as above
	// have processes with multiple high, and low bust times -- should confuse 	sjf's exponential algorithm
how does priorety change the efficiency of the scheduleds? //SIDE-NOTE this only really has an affect on the feedback round robin, but would be interesting to see how the efficiency changes
	// only really effexts feedback round robin
	// useful comparison against other schedulers
	// only really comparing frr against other schedulers
	// use high burt high priority && low busrt low priority
		// and visa versa
			// low prio high busrst

10 processes for each test
4 sets of tests to run for each experiment
3 * 4 = 12 sets of tests to analyse for each experiment
how many tests? e1-3 e2-3 e3-4
total of 40 sets of data overall
	10 proesses for each test
		upto 10 bursts for each process
			
low burst time < 50
high burst time > 100
e1
	// high no if no of bursts per process
	// low no of bursts per process
	// equal mix high/low - equal mix of bursts
	
e2
// focus on bust times not number of bursts
	// equal mix of high and low burst times
	// all high burst times
	// all low burst times
	// mostly 2/3 or 3/4 high burst times 1/3 or 1/4 low burst times

e3
// equally distribute priorities, and burst times.
	// processes 1/2 high priority high burst times 1/2 low priority low burst times - same no of bursts
	//1/2 high priority low burst time 1/2 low priority high burst time
	// high prio 2/1 high/low // low prio 2/1 high/low
	// high prio 2/1 low/high // low prio 2/1 low/high
